# Beacon

### Description

Everyday, thousands of consumers have to think about which grocery store to go to and whether or not the store will have the items they need in stock, all because of the pandemic. Thatâ€™s why we built Beacon - to help consumers get access to accurate, crowdsourced store data including lines and stock information for free of charge so that everyone can shop easier.

### How it works

Beacon operates on crowdsourced data. Essentially, consumers do the following when they log in to Beacon:
1. Search for existing store data to help them initially shop
2. Find the store data they need and go to the appropriate store
3. Shop and contribute back to Beacon's data

### Tech Stack

- `Python`, `Flask`, `MongoDB`
- `React`, `Redux`, `SCSS`
